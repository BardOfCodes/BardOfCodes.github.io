  Hey there! I am a Maths Graduate student, deeply interested in fields like Stochastic processes,
  Statistical inference, machine learning and abstract algebra. I look forward to any project
   or research opportunities in these fields. You can check out my earlier projects
  <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}projects/" target="_blank">here</a>, or read my random thoughts
  <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}blog/" target="_blank">here</a>.
</p>

I am currently in my final year as a student of the Int. M. Sc. in Applied Mathematics degree
at IIT-roorkee. Over the past few years, I have had the previlage to learn about some of the most
interesting patterns in our world, be it in Finance, or Real-Analysis, or music.

Oh, and music reminds me, I have been an active musician(mainly guitarist) for the past 10 years. I was
the Secretary of Music Section,IIT-R for the academic year of 2015-2016. Listing out favourites
would not go well with my conscience, but for starters, I am a huge fan of Queens, Guthrie Govan,
Shafqat Amanat Ali, Chet Baker, Kishore Kumar, Snarky Puppy, Claude Debussy...

Currently, I am fostering my relations with the machines. 'How to train your machine' is probably
a book that I would like to write down someday.I have been involved in understanding the mathematical
aspect of all the popular machine learning algorithms. Formulating a sound functional analysis of
such statistical as well as heuristic algorithms seems to be a very important work. I hope to
apply my skills in that domain.

This web site has been made using jekyll, hosted on github-pages.My theme is built on the ['Hyde'](http://hyde.getpoole.com/)
 theme, which is again built on the ['Poole'](http://getpoole.com/) theme. Believe me, these themes are just
 as awesome as their naming is.
