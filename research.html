          Hi, I am Aditya Ganeshan, currently working as a Researcher at Preferred Networks Inc, Japan.
          Before this I worked as a Research Assistant at Video Analytics Lab, IISc, Bangalore, India.
          My research centers around <i> Deep learning for perception and creative applications.</i>.
          Earlier, I was very curious about the stability of deep features, and published 2 works which explore adversarial attacks.

          Lately, I have been more driven towards traditional Computer Vision problems, such as video analysis, scene
          reconstruction and image rectification. Hold on to your seat belts for a few publications in that direction
          in the near future!
        </p>
        <p>
          Listed below are domains (at a very high level) where I would like to make contributions. These are based on the
          instersection between my skills, my interests, and the impactfulness of the problem.

          <ol>
            <li>
              Perception using Deep learning: Be it robotics, or AR, perception will play a key role.
            </li>
            <li>
              Procedural Generation: As more and more of human population becomes avid consumers, content generation becomes
              an increasingly massive problem. Further, generative modelling can assist creative endeavors by assisting search
              across possibilities.
            </li>
          </ol>

        </p>
        </p>
          I completed my Integrated Masters of Science in Applied Mathematics from IIT Roorkee in 2017.
          I am still a young researcher in this field, and look forward to pursuing doctoral research in this field,
          when the time and place is right!
        </p>

        <p>
          <underline> My Current Research Goals: </unerline>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Semi-supervised methods for data efficient learning in autonomous driving.
            </li>
            <li>
              Scene Parsing for largescale 3D data.
            </li>
            <li>
              Benefits of using VR at workplace.
            </li>
