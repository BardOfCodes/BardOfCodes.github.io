Hi, I am Aditya Ganeshan, currently working as a Researcher at Preferred Networks Inc, Japan. 
Before this I worked as a Research Assistant at Video Analytics Lab, IISc, Bangalore, India. 
My research centers around Deep Learning and its applications. 
I am also depply curious about the Stability of Deep Features, and few of my earlier publications (below) deal with adversarial samples of various kinds. Other publications deal with applications of Deep Learning, such as estimating 3D pose of objects from 2D images. 
  </p>
  </p>
I completed my Integrated Masters of Science in Applied Mathematics from IIT Roorkee in 2017. 
So, I am still a young researcher in this field, and look forward to pursuing doctoral research in this field, when the time and place is right!
  </p>

<underline> My Research Goals: </unerline>
<ol> 
  <li> 
    Why are Deep Features unstable? How can we make Deep Features stable? And we do, will it avert the dangerous implications of adversarial samples?
  </li>
  <li> 
    Applying deep learning based approaches for real life problems, (and nurturing them towards viable products).
  </li>
</ol>
