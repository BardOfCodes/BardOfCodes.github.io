          Hi, I am Aditya Ganeshan, currently working as a Researcher at Preferred Networks Inc, Japan.
          Before this, I worked as a Research Assistant at Video Analytics Lab, IISc, Bangalore, India.
          My research centers around Deep learning for computer vision and creative applications.
          Earlier, I was very curious about the stability of deep features, and published 2 works which explore adversarial attacks.
          Lately, I have been more driven towards traditional Computer Vision problems, such as video analysis, scene reconstruction
          and semi-supervised learning.

        </p>
        </p>
          I completed my Integrated Masters of Science in Applied Mathematics from IIT Roorkee in 2017.
          I am still a young researcher in this field, and look forward to pursuing doctoral research in this field,
          when the time and place is right!
        </p>

        <p>
          <underline> Some of my current research project are exploring the following topics: </unerline>
