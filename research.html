          Hi, I am Aditya Ganeshan, currently working as a Researcher at Preferred Networks Inc, Japan.
          Before this I worked as a Research Assistant at Video Analytics Lab, IISc, Bangalore, India.
          My research centers around <i>Deep Learning and its applications</i>.
          I am very curious about the stability of deep features, and one of my earlier publications (below) deal with
          adversarial samples of various kinds. Other publications deal with application of deep learning, such as
          estimating 3D pose of objects from 2D images.
        </p>
        </p>
          I completed my Integrated Masters of Science in Applied Mathematics from IIT Roorkee in 2017.
          I am still a young researcher in this field, and look forward to pursuing doctoral research in this field,
          when the time and place is right!
        </p>

        <p>
          <underline> My Research Goals: </unerline>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Why are deep features unstable? How can we make deep features stable? And if we do, will it avert the
              dangerous implications of adversarial samples?
            </li>
            <li>
              Applying deep learning based approaches for real life problems, (and hopefully nurture them towards viable
              products!).
            </li>
