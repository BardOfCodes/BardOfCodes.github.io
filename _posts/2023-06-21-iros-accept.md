Our Paper titled: Skill Generalization With Verbs, got accepted at IROS 2023. This project was spearheaded by the talented [Rachel Ma](https://rachelma80000.github.io/). My contributions were in helping craft the idea (optimizing urdf parameters to maximize verb probability with a learnt CNN) and some initial exploration with image based verb understanding.
