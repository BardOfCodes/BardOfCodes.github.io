Our Paper titled: Improving Unsupervised Visual Program Inference with Code Rewriting Families, got accepted at ICCV 2023. I wanted to exploit the malleability of symbolic representations, and this project takes a stab at that (under the setting of visual program inference). Code, website, paper to be released soon.
