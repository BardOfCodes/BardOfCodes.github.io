I worked as a head volunteer for organizing [RLDM - 2022](https://rldm.org/) (The Multi-disciplinary Conference on Reinforcement Learning and Decision Making) here at Brown university! Thoroughly enjoyed working with the other head volunteers: [Olga Lositsky](http://www.princeton.edu/~lositsky/), [Blossom Metevier](https://bmetevier.github.io/), and [Yash Shukla](https://yshukla.com/)!
