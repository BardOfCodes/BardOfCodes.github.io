Finished my second semester with the following two courses: [CSCI2240: Interactive Computer Graphics](https://dritchie.github.io/csci2240/) by Daniel Ritchie (finally wrote a path tracer, and worked on neuralSDFs for simulation!) and [CSCI2952-N:Advanced Topics in Deep Learning](https://brown-cs2952n.github.io/spring2022/) by Chen Sun (finally got around to *really* reading transformers).
