Finished my forth semester with the following two courses: [CSCI1710: Logic for Systems](https://csci1710.github.io/2023/) by Tim Nelson (implemented SAT solvers, cool final project with [Arman](https://armanmaesumi.github.io/) on stable polyomino packings!) and [CSCI 2951X: Reintegrating AI](https://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs2951x/) by George Konidaris (worked on a bootstrapped Abstraction Discovery system titled "Branching BAD". Code to be released soon).
