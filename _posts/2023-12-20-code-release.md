I released the code for [GeoLIPI: A DSL for Implicit Geometric Modelling](https://github.com/BardOfCodes/geolipi). Its my attempt at putting together different code pieces I deal with constantly into one place. The code is still in its infancy, and I will be adding more features to it as I go along.
