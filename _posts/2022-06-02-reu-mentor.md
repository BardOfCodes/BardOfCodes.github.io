I am working as a study group leader at Brown CS's first [REU site](https://aireu.cs.brown.edu/) on the topic of AI for Computational Creativity! I am accompanied by the awesome [Catherine Chen](https://catherineschen.github.io/), [Zainab Iftikhar](https://cs.brown.edu/people/grad/ziftikha/) and [Roma Patel](https://cs.brown.edu/people/rpatel59/) in the quest to impart some research methods knowledge to the 8 selected undergraduates!
